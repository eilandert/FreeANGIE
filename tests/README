Test suite for Angie.

Use prove to run tests as one usually do for perl tests.  Individual tests
may be run as well.

Note: tests run Angie (and backend daemons if needed) listening on localhost
and may use various ports in 8000 .. 8999 range.

Usage:

    $ TEST_ANGIE_BINARY=/path/to/angie prove .

By default tests expect Angie binary to be at ../objs/angie.

Environment variables:

TEST_ANGIE_BINARY

    Sets path to Angie binary to be tested, defaults to "../objs/angie".

TEST_ANGIE_MODULES

    Sets path to modules directory, defaults to dirname of TEST_ANGIE_BINARY.

TEST_ANGIE_VERBOSE

    Be a bit more verbose (in particular, print requests sent and responses
    got from Angie).  Note that this requires prove -v (or HARNESS_VERBOSE).

TEST_ANGIE_LEAVE

    If set, temporary directory with configs and logs won't be deleted on test
    completion.  Useful for debugging.

TEST_ANGIE_CATLOG

    Cat error log to stdout after test completion.  Useful for debugging.

TEST_ANGIE_UNSAFE

    Run unsafe tests.

TEST_ANGIE_GLOBALS

    Sets additional directives in main context.

TEST_ANGIE_GLOBALS_HTTP

    Sets additional directives in http context.

TEST_ANGIE_GLOBALS_STREAM

    Sets additional directives in stream context.

Happy testing!
